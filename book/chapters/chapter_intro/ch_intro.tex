\section{About This Book}

In recent years several books have been published  on the topics of Algorithmic Trading and Quantitative Strategies. Some books provide broad non-quantitative overviews of the subject while others are strictly academic, quantitative, treatments of one or more advanced theoretical topics. While these books hold a wealth of  information , we believe that none expose the reader to the complete picture, including the business aspects, the  practical challenges, and the tools needed for a quantitative researcher (aka Quant) to effectively operate.  This book strives to achieve exactly this goal. It is written by one academic that has studied and taught the methods of Quantitative Finance for over 20 years, and two senior quantitative practitioners with a combined 25$+$ years of experience in Electronic Trading who have worked (and still work) for some of the largest trading operations in the world. Bringing together these two diverse perspectives give the authors an opportunity to provide a unique,  practical, and integrated view of the field.


This book gives an inside look into the world of Electronic Trading and Quantitative Strategies addressing  actual challenges  often ignored by more academic treatments, evaluating past solutions, and presenting innovative ideas on how to approach them in the future. The subject is  then significantly deepened through a more formal mathematical treatment in order to provide the necessary quantitative methods as well as a targeted review of the relevant academic literature.


By construction (as well as by the obvious writing limitations of the authors) the book will thus present two very distinctive writing styles: one more high level, jargon ridden and conspicuously non rigorous, the other,  more formal and mathematical.  This dual approach is also reflective of the dynamics typical of quants working on a trading floor where commercial needs, time to market, and other practical considerations often supersede rigor and aesthetics of highly mathematical models, in favor of intuitively simple approaches. We hope that the reader will embrace this dual writing style.


Our approach to the more quantitative topics in this book is again, somewhat unique. In the spirit of providing the reader with the hands-on tools they need, this book will be accompanied by a collection of practical Jupyter Notebooks where select methods are applied to real data. This will allow the reader to go beyond theory into the actual implementation, while familiarizing them with the libraries available. Wherever possible the charts and tables in the book are generated directly from these notebooks and the data-sets provided bring further life to the treatment of the subject. We also add  exercises that the student can work through some of these problems on their own. The notebooks as well as the data and the exercises are made  available for free on: \url{https://github.com/NehrenD/algo_trading_book}.


While working through this book the reader should be able to create all the building blocks needed for a complete solution. They will also understand the context and challenges they will face in real life, and gain insight into how the field evolved in its sometimes dizzying complexity. We hope that the readers will enjoy this journey as much as the authors have enjoyed creating this ``guided tour'' into the workings of Electronic Trading and Quantitative Strategies, one of the most active and exciting spaces in the world of finance.

% How The Book is Structured
\section{How The Book is Structured}

This book is divided into five parts. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Part~0 sets the stage for our journey. After a whirlwind tour through the history and evolution of Equity Trading we will delve into a review of the current features of modern Market Structure in all its glory, chaos and (over-)complexity. This gives the reader context on the business aspects of trading in order for them to understand why things work as they do. The next section will provide a brief high-level overview of market microstructure which explains and models the dynamics of a trading venue  heavily influenced by the core mechanism in which trading usually takes place: the price-time priority limit-order book with continuous double auction. This will set the stage for the introduction of a critical but elusive concept in trading: Liquidity.

\item Part~I provides the foundational theory of stochastic processes and their connection to time series models applied to equity trading, and one of the core datasets in finance: Market Data. We will address univariate and multivariate time series models of both mean and variance of asset returns, and other associated quantities such as volume. While somewhat less used today, these models are important  as conceptual frameworks, and act as baselines for more advanced methods. The last chapter of Part 1 will present more advanced topics like State-Space Models and the applications of modern Machine Learning methods.

\item Part~II dives into the broad topic of Quantitative Trading. Here we provide the reader with a toolkit to confidently approach the subject. Historical perspectives to general approaches to Alpha generation to critical insights into the art of backtesting and its mine fields are covered here. Since most quantitative strategies are portfolio based, meaning that alphas are usually combined  and optimized over a basket of securities, we will briefly introduce the topic of Active Portfolio Management and Mean-Variance Optimization, and the more advanced topic of Dynamic Portfolio Selection. We conclude this section discussing a somewhat orthogonal topic:  News and Sentiment Analytics. Our intent is to also remind the reader that the field is never ``complete'' as new approaches (such as behavioral finance) and datasets become available and are embraced by practitioners.

\item Part~III is dedicated to Execution Algorithms, a sub-field of Quantitative Trading which has evolved separately from simple mechanical workflow tools, into a multi-billion dollar business. We begin from the ground up by reviewing various approaches to modeling trade data. We then do a deeper dive into the fundamental subject of Market Impact, one of the most complex and least understood concepts in the whole of finance. Having set the stage, the final section is dedicated to an in depth review of the evolution of and the current state of the art in Execution Algorithms.

\item Finally, Part~IV deals with several of the more technical aspects of developing both quantitative trading strategies and execution algorithms. Trading is a highly technological process that requires the integration of numerous technologies and systems,  ranging from market data feeds, to exchange connectivity, to low-latency networking and co-location, to back-office booking and reporting. Developing a modern and highly performing trading platform requires much consideration and compromise. In these chapters, we look at some of the most important details in creating a full end-to-end technology stack for electronic trading. We also dedicate a chapter to the critical but often ignore aspect of a successful trading business: The research environment.
