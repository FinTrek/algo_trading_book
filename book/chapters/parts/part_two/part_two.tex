In this part of the book, we present trading algorithms based on statistical analyses of market data. These analyses are also guided by established principles in financial economics. The market is assumed to consist of informed and noise traders. It is also postulated that the market is efficient, and the informed traders generally gain at the expense of noise traders. Any information about a stock is quickly impounded in price by the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH). If there are anomalies, statistical arbitrage techniques can be employed to successfully detect and exploit them for profitable opportunities. These methodologies that were developed in the low frequency setting need to be carefully reconsidered to be successfully extended to the high frequency setting. In that space, the focus of traders has also been on Execution Strategies which are covered in Part~III.


In Chapter~\ref{ch:stat_ts}, we present some commonly used strategies based on the statistical methods described in Part~I. Although the literature is replete with numerous strategies, most of them are some variations or combinations of basic strategies described here. As price-based strategies have been fully exploited, it is important to consider strategies that use other information such as volume, market volatility, related stock performance, etc. Also presented are improved strategies based on machine learning methods. In Chapter~\ref{ch:amp}, we discuss portfolio theory---fundamental to diversification of risk and how the investment/trading strategies are handled. As portfolio rebalancing is quite common and because rebalancing requires trading, this chapter provides a comprehensive view of investment strategies with transaction costs. We conclude this part with Chapter~\ref{chap:ch_news_an} that deals with the analysis based on news and sentiment. This is essential as short-term price movements are not easily explained by the economic indicators that are slow to vary and the stock related events such as earnings announcements occur only on periodic basis. The sentiment analysis captures an understanding of how noise traders trade and can be considered as part of the emerging area of Behavioral Finance.
