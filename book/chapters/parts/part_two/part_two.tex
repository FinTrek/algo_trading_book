In this part of the book, we present trading algorithms based on statistical analysis of market data. The analysis are also guided by established financial principles. The market is assumed to consist of informed and noise traders gain at the expense of noise traders. Informed traders gain at the expense of noise traders. It is also postulated that when the market is efficient. Any information about a stock is quickly impounded in the price by the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH). If there are anomalies, statistical arbitrage techniques can be employed to successfully detect and exploit them for profitable opportunities. Recent evolution of electronic markets have given rise to high-frequency trading based on computing technology. So the methodologies that were developed in the low frequency setting need to be carefully reconsidered. But in the high-frequency setting, the focus on the traders has been on Execution Strategies which are covered in Part~III.


In Chapter~\ref{ch:stat_ts}, we present some commonly used strategies based on the statistical methods described in Part~I. Although the literature is replete with numerous strategies, most of them are some variations or combinations of basic strategies described here. As price-based strategies have been fully exploited, it is important to consider other information such as volume, market volatility, related stock performance, etc.. Also presented are improved strategies based on machine learning methods. In Chapter~\ref{ch:amp}, we discuss portfolio theory---fundamental to diversification of risk and how the investment/trading strategies are handled. As portfolio rebalancing is quite common and the rebalancing requires trading, this chapter provides a comprehensive view of investment strategies. We conclude this part with Chapter~\ref{chap:ch_news_an} that deals with the analysis based on news and sentiment. This is essential as short-term price movements are hard to be explained by the economic indicators that are slow to vary and the stock related events \dots earnings announcements occur only on periodic basis. \dots to an excellent how the noise \dots
