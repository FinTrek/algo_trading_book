We provide a brief introduction to the book on the overall content and structure, and some basics of trading are covered. The initial part of Chapter~\ref{chap:ch_trading_fund} delves into a discussion of the market structure and trading from the practitioner's point of view. The terms used in this part, all can be traced back to academic literature; but the discussion is kept simple and direct. The data, which is central to all the analyses and inferences, is then introduced. The complexity of using data that can arise at irregular intervals can be better understood with an example illustrated here. Finally, the last part of this chapter contains a brief academic review of market microstructure---a topic about the mechanics of trading and how the trading can be influenced by various market designs.
