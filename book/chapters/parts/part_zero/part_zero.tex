With a brief introduction to the book on the overall content and structure, some basics of trading are covered. The initial part of Chapter~\ref{chap:ch_trading_fund} delves into a discussion of the market structure and trading from the practitioner's point of view. The terms used in this part, all can be traced back to academic literature; but the discussion is kept simple and direct. The data, which is central to all the analyses and inferences, is then introduction. The complexity of using data that can arise at any point in time can be better understood with an example illustrated here. Finally, the last part of this Chapter contains a brief academic discussion of market microstructure---a topic on the mechanics of trading and how it is influenced by various market structures.
