In this part of the book, we cover a core topic in Algorithmic Trading: Execution Strategies. Once again, we will strive to give, from the practitioner's perspective and context, the necessary building blocks to grasp the subject and finally, the quantitative underpinnings. Our hope is that in reading this part, our readers would have enough understanding of the topic to be able to develop a basic implementation of an execution product and be able to create supporting Pre and Post-trade analytics.


We start in Chapter~\ref{chap:ch_trade_data_models} by discussing the modeling of trade data. We focus on several fundamental topics that are critical to practitioners but are not given enough attention by other treatments of the subject. Details on some of the analytics used in practice are presented. Chapter~\ref{chap:ch_mi_models} then explains one of the fundamental subjects of execution: Market Impact (MI). We bring in the intuition on the inner works of market impact and build the functional form of standard MI models from first principles. We then go into more details through a review of select literature to guide the reader that may be interested in more depth. Finally, Chapter~\ref{chap:ch_exec_models} reviews the core details of the topic by covering Execution Strategies and their components. Here again we give a practical perspective with a hope of setting the reader on a more solid understanding of the issues faced in industry.
