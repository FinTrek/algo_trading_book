In this part of the book, we cover another core topic in Algorithmic Trading: Execution Strategies. Once again, we will strive to give, from the practitioner's perspective and context, the necessary building blocks to grasp the subject and finally, the quantitative underpinnings. Our hope is that in reading this part, our readers would have enough understanding of the topic to be able to develop a basic implementation of an execution product and be able to create supporting Pre and Post-trade analytics.


We start in Chapter~\ref{chap:ch_trade_data_models} by discussing the modeling of trade data. We focus on several fundamental topics that are critical to practitioners but are not given enough attention by other treatments of the subject. We provide details on some of the analytics used in practice. Chapter~\ref{chap:ch_mi_models} then explains one of the fundamental subjects of execution: Market Impact (MI). We bring in the intuition on the inner works of market impact and build the functional form of standard MI models from first principles. We then go into more details through a review of sizable literature to guide the reader that is interested in more depth. Finally, Chapter~\ref{chap:ch_exec_models} goes into the core details of the topic by covering Execution Strategies and their components. Here again we give a practical perspective that addresses many of the misconceptions present in the industry with the hope of setting the reader on a more solid footing.
