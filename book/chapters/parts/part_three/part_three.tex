In this part of the book, we cover the other core topic: Execution Strategies. Once again, we will strive to give the practitioner perspective and context, the necessary building blocks to fully grasp the subject and finally the quantitative underpinning where available.  Our hope is that by the end of the chapter our readers would have enough understanding of the topic to be able, if asked, to develop a basic implementation of an execution product and be able to create the supporting Pre and Post-trade analytics.


We start in Chapter~\ref{chap:ch_trade_data_models} by discussing the modeling of trade data. We focus on several fundamental topics that are critical to practitioners but often disregarded by other treatments of the subject. We provide details on many of the analytics used in practice. Chapter~\ref{chap:ch_mi_models} then explains one of the fundamental subjects of execution: Market Impact. We strive to bring in the intuition on the inner works of market impact and build the functional form of standard MI models from first principles. We then go into more details through a review of  sizable literature to guide the student that is interested in more depth. Finally, Chapter~\ref{chap:ch_exec_models} goes into the real meat of the topic by covering Execution Strategies and its component. Here we strive to give a modern perspective that tries to address many of the misconceptions present in the industry with the hope of setting the reader on more solid footing from the start.
