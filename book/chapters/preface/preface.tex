Algorithms have been around since the day trading has started. But they have gained importance with the advent of computers and the automation of trading. Efficiency in execution has taken center stage and with that, speed and instantaneous processing of asset related information have become important. In this book, we will focus on the methodology rooted in financial theory and demonstrate how relevant data---both in the high frequency and in the low frequency---can be meaningfully analyzed. The intention is to bring both the academics and the practitioners together. We strive to achieve what George Box (first author's teacher) once said: \par
        \begin{center}
        \begin{minipage}[t]{0.7\textwidth}
        	\raggedright
          	{\itshape``One important idea is that science is a means whereby learning is achieved, not by mere theoretical speculation on the one hand, nor by the undirected accumulation of practical facts on the other, but rather by a motivated iteration between theory and practice.''}
        \end{minipage} 
        \end{center}

We hope that we provide a framework for relevant inquiries on this topic. To quote Judea Pearl, \par
        \begin{center}
        \begin{minipage}[t]{0.7\textwidth}
        	\raggedright
          	{\itshape``You cannot answer a question that you cannot ask, and you cannot ask a question that you have no words for.''}
        \end{minipage} 
        \end{center}
The emphasis of this book, the readers will notice, is on data analysis with guidance from appropriate models. As C.R. Rao (the first author's teacher) has aptly observed: \vspace{0.5\baselineskip}

\noindent All knowledge is, in final analysis, history. \par
\noindent All Sciences are, in the abstract, mathematics. \par
\noindent All judgements are, in the rationale, statistics. \twomedskip


The ideas for this book were planted ten years ago, while the first author, Raja Velu, was visiting the Statistics Department at Stanford at the invitation of Professor T.W. Anderson. Professor Tze-Leung Lai, who was in charge of the Financial Mathematics program, suggested initiating a course on Algorithmic Trading. This course was developed by the first author and the other authors, Daniel Nehren and Maxence Hardy, offered guest lectures to bring the practitioner's view to the classroom. This book in large part is the result of that interaction. We want to gratefully acknowledge the opportunity given by the Stanford's Statistics department and by Professors Lai and Anderson. 


We owe personal debt to many people for their invaluable comments and intellectual contribution to many sources from which the material for this book is drawn. The critical reviews by Professors Guofu Zhou and Ruey Tsay at various stages of writing are gratefully acknowledged. Colleagues from Syracuse University, Jan Ondrich, Ravi Shukla, David Weinbaum, Lai Xu, Suhasini Subba Rao from Texas A\&M, and Jeffrey Wurgler from New York University, all read through various versions of this book. Their comments have helped to improve its content and the presentation. Students who took the course at Stanford University, National University of Singapore and Singapore Management University and the teaching assistants were instrumental in shaping the structure of the book. In particular, we want to recognize the help of Balakumar Balasubramaniam, who offered extensive comments on an earlier version. On the intellectual side, we have drawn materials from the classic books by Tsay (2010); Box, Jenkins, Reinsel, Ljung (2015) on the methodology. Campbell, Lo and Mackinlay (1996) on finance; Friedman, Hastie and Tibshirani (2009) on statistical learning. In the tone and substance at times, we could not say better than what is already said in these classics and so the readers may notice some similarities.


We have relied heavily on the able assistance of Caleb McWhorter, who has put the book together with all the demands of his own graduate work. We want to thank our doctoral students, Kris Herman and Zhaoque Zhou (Chosen) for their help at various stages of the book. The joint work with them was useful to draw upon for content. As the focus of this book is on the use of real data, we relied upon several sources for help. We want to thank Professor Ravi Jagannathan for sharing his thoughts and data on pairs trading in Chapter~\ref{ch:stat_ts} and Kris Herman, whose notes on the Hawkes process are used in Chapter~\ref{chap:ch_trade_data_models}. The sentiment data used in Chapter~\ref{chap:ch_news_an} was provided by iSentium and thanks to Gautham Sastri. Scott Morris, William Dougan and Peter Layton at Blackthorne Inc, whose willingness to help on a short notice, whether it is related to data or trading strategies is very much appreciated. We want to also acknowledge editorial help from Claire Harshberber and Alyson Nehren. 


Generous support was provided by Whitman School of Management and the Department of Finance for the production of the book. Raja Velu would like to thank former Dean Kenneth Kavajecz and Professors Ravi Shukla and Peter Koveos who serve(d) as department chairs for their encouragement and support.

Last but not least the authors are grateful and humbled to have Adam Hogan provide the artwork for the book cover. The original piece specifically made for this book is a beautiful example of  Algorithmic Art representing trading intensity of the US stock universe on the various trading venues. We cannot think of a more fitting image for this book.  


Finally, no words will suffice for the love and support of our families. \vspace{3\baselineskip}
