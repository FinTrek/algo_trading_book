Algorithms have been around since the day trading has started. But they have gained importance with the advent of computers and the automation of trading. Efficiency in execution has taken center stage and with that, speed and instantaneous processing of asset related information have become important. In this book, we will focus on the methodology rooted in financial theory and demonstrate how relevant data---both in the high frequency and in the low frequency---can be meaningfully analyzed. The intention is to bring both the academics and the practitioners together. We strive to achieve what George Box once said: \par

        \begin{minipage}[t]{0.7\textwidth}
        	\raggedright
          	{\itshape``One important idea is that science is a means whereby learning is achieved, not by mere theoretical speculation on the one hand, nor by the undirected accumulation of practical facts on the other, but rather by a motivated iteration between theory and practice.''}
        \end{minipage} 
        \end{center}


The ideas for this book were planted ten years ago. The first author, Raja Velu, was visiting the Statistics Department at Stanford at the invitation of Professor T.W. Anderson and has offered courses in time series. Professor Tze-Leung Lai, who was in charge of the Financial Mathematics program, suggested initiating a course on Algorithmic Trading. This course was developed by the first author and the other authors, Daniel Nehren and Maxence Hardy, offered lectures to bring the practitioner's view to the classroom. This book in large part is the result of that interaction. We want to gratefully acknowledge the opportunity given by the Stanford's Statistics department and by Professors Lai and Anderson. 


We owe personal debt to many people for their invaluable comments and intellectual contribution to many sources from which the material for this book is drawn. The critical reviews by Professors Guofu Zhou and Ruey Tsay at various stages of writing are gratefully acknowledged. Colleagues from Syracuse, Lai Xu, David Weinbaum and Jan Ondrich have read through initial versions of this book and offered some valuable suggestions. Professor Suhasini Subba Rao and Mohsen Pourahmadi from Texas A\&M all have read parts of this book and their comments have helped improve its content and its presentation. Students who took the course Stanford and National University of Singapore and the teaching assistants were instrumental in shaping the structure of the book. On the intellectual side, we have drawn materials from the classic books by Tsay (2010); Box, Jenkins, Reinsel, Ljung (2015) on the methodology. Campbell, Lo and Mackinlay (1996) on finance; Friedman, Hastie and Tibshirani (2009) on machine learning. In the tone and substance at times, we could not say better than what is already said in the classics and so the readers may notice some similarities.


We have relied heavily on the able assistance of Caleb McWhorter, who has put the book together with all the demands of his own graduate work. We want to thank our doctoral students, Kris Herman and Zhaoque Zhou (Chosen) for their help at various stages of the book. The joint work with them was useful to draw upon for contents. As the focus of this book is on the use of real data, we relied upon several sources for help. We want to thank Professor Ravi Jagannathan for sharing his thoughts and data on pairs trading in Chapter~\ref{ch:stat_ts} and Kris Herman, whose notes on the Hawkes process are used in Chapter~\ref{chap:ch_trade_data_models}. The sentiment data used in Chapter~\ref{chap:ch_news_an} was provided by iSentium and thanks to Gautham Sastri. We owe a great deal of debt to Scott Morris, William Dougan and Peter Layton at Blackthorne Inc, whose willingness to help on a short notice, whether it is related to data or trading strategies.


Generous support was provided by Whitman School of Management and the Department of Finance for the production of the book. \todo{To be added}


Finally, no words will suffice for the love and support of our families. \vspace{3\baselineskip}
