\begin{center} {\large\bfseries Algorithmic Trading and Quantitative Strategies} \end{center}

Algorithms have been around since the day trading started. But they have gained increased important with the advent of computers and the automation of trading. Efficiency in execution has taken a center stage and with that spread and instantaneous processing of asset related information have become important. In this book, we focus on the relevant methodology rooted in financial theory and demonstrate how relevant data---both in the high frequency and in the low frequency---can be meaningfully analyzed. 


The intention is to bring both the academic and practitioners together. We strive to achieve what George Box once said: \par
